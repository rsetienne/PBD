\arguments{
\item{eri}{one single extinction rate of the incipient species, or mu_2 in
article, in probability per time unit}

\item{scr}{one single speciation completion rate, or lambda_2 in article, in
probability per time unit}

\item{siri}{one single speciation initiation rate of incipient species, or
lambda_3 in article, in probability per time unit}
}
\value{
the means duration of speciation, in time units
}

Calculate the mean duration of speciation (equations 19 and 20 of reference
article), non-vectorized
