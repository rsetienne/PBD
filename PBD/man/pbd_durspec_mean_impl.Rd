\title{Actual calculation of the mean duration of speciation
(equations 19 and 20 of reference article)
assuming all inputs are correct}

}
\arguments{
\item{la2}{lambda_2, the speciation completion rate,
in probability per time unit}

\item{la3}{lambda_3, speciation initiation rate of incipient species,
in probability per time unit}

\item{mu2}{mu_2 extinction rate of the incipient species,
in probability per time unit}
